# @bluvenit/astro-adapter-azure

This is an experimental adapter for the [Astro](https://astro.build) static site builder. It allows you to deploy your Astro site to Azure Static Web Apps including support for API routes. For now API Routes / SSR only supports routes in the `/api` route, this is a limitation of Azure Static Web Apps.
